This application demonstrates the use of the _flattening by expansion_
technique [1] for drawing cubic bezier curves. The application is
written in [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) and builds on the
[Futhark Lys Library](https://github.com/diku-dk/lys).

The implementation also supports antialiased drawing of linear bezier
curves (i.e., lines) with partly support for antialiased drawing of
cubic bezier curves; we still need to perform some calculations on the
derivative, which should be easy to do; see the screen capture below,
which demonstrates how antialiasing improves the visual appearance.

## Running it

To build and run the application, do as follows:

````
$ cd src
$ futhark pkg sync
$ make
$ ./bezier -i
````

## Future Work

By splitting the curves appropriately, we may be able to predict
better the exact number of pixels required to draw a continuous cubic
bezier curve. It would also be great to understand how we should blend
two crossing antialised lines.
